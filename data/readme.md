The complete source code, pre-trained weights of FUSAR-KLIP, and the full FUSAR-GEOVL-1M dataset are currently being organized and will be fully open-sourced upon the official publication of our paper. As a preliminary reference, we have provided a curated subset of 1,000 high-quality samples (including multi-dimensional geographic annotations such as Terrain, Layout, and Buildings) in the repository to demonstrate our data structure and HCoT-guided annotation paradigm. Stay tuned!
